It’s been just over a decade since the American television show CSI: Crime Scene Investigation first aired. During that time, facial recognition software has become increasingly sophisticated. Present-day software isn’t limited by superficial features like skin or hair color—instead, it identifies faces based on facial features that are more stable through changes in appearance, like eye shape and distance between eyes. This type of facial recognition is called “template matching”. You can use OpenCV, Deep learning, or a custom database to create facial recognition systems/applications. 

Process of detecting a face from an image:

Find face locations and encodings,
Extract features using face embedding,
Face recognition, compare those faces.
